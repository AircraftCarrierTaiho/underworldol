#### gameplay
underworld is a TCGwhere players will take on the role of a hidden association and then compete for areas. The areas that are contested are counted as points. The first side to reach a given score wins.
#### Regarding the game's worldview, it is a fictional world that is parallel to reality.
There are everyday things that we know: cities, countries and institutions of all kinds that resemble reality. There are also countless supernatural things lurking behind the curtain of reality: fae monsters in human form walking in the shadows of the streets and alleys, supernatural people relying on various identities to cover their tracks, sects spreading the seeds of destruction, vampire families plotting to seize power in the human world, and secret departments of the government removing various threats.
